# GraphQL Middleware

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸš§">
**Subject to change** <br/>
Resolver-based middleware is functional and fully implemented but its API might be subject to change. 
It is currently only supported as extensions to [Graphiti](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti), and only available in `v1.2.0-beta.1` or higher.

Middlewares are useful reusable code that can be easily attached to resolvers.
It allows you to perform operations on incoming operations before they get to the field resolver and on outgoing responses before they are sent back.

## Creating a middleware

GraphQL middleware is a function that takes 2 arguments:
 1. Resolver parameters - _All information given to the resolver (root, args, context)_
 2. Next function - _Function to control the execution of the next middleware and the resolver to which it is attached_

```swift {5} showLineNumbers copy filename="Specific resolver middleware"
public func MinZeroResult(
    params: ResolverParameters<Resolver, Context, NoArguments>,
    next: @escaping () -> Int
) async throws -> Int {
    try await min(next(), 0)
}
```

```swift {3,5-6} showLineNumbers copy filename="Reusable generic middleware"
public func Trace<Root, Args, Returned>() -> GraphQLMiddleware<Root, Context, Args, Returned> {
    return { params, next in
        let before = Date()
        let res = try await next()
        let after = Date()
        params.ctx.logger.info("Operation takes \(after.timeIntervalSince(before))s")
        return res
    }
}
```

### Intercepting the resolver

Middleware also has the ability to intercept the result of a resolver's execution.

As an example would be an auth guard:

```swift {3-5} showLineNumbers copy
public func Auth<Root, Args, Returned>() -> GraphQLMiddleware<Root, Context, Args, Returned> {
    return { params, next in
        guard case .some = params.ctx.user else {
            throw GraphQLError(message: "Not authenticated") 
        }
        return try await next()
    }
}
```

Another one would be a cache interceptor:

```swift {5-7} showLineNumbers copy
public func Cached<Root, Returned: RESPValueConvertible>(
  key: String
) -> GraphQLMiddleware<Root, Context, NoArguments, Returned> {
    return { params, next in
        guard let cache = try? await redis.get(key, as: Returned.self).get() else {
          return cache
        }
        return try await next()
    }
}
```

## Attaching Middleware

Attaching middlewares can be done through the `use` parameter from `Field`. The order of the middleware is also important.

```swift {3,8} showLineNumbers copy
Query {
    // Trace -> Cached -> Resolver
    Field("books", at: Resolver.books, use: [Trace(), Cached(key: "query:books")])
}

Mutation {
    // Auth -> Trace -> Resolver 
    Field("createBook", at: Resolver.createBook, use: [Auth(), Trace()])
}
```
