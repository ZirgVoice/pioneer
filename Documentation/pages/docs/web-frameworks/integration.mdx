## Building integrations

<Callout type="info">
  This section is for *authors* of web frameworks integrations. Before building
  a new integration, it's recommended seeing if there's an
  [integration](#open-source-integrations) for your framework of choice that

### Implementing GraphQL over HTTP

First, the HTTP layer. Pioneer provide a method [.executeHTTPGraphQLRequest](<https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneerexecutehttpgraphqlrequest(for:with:using)>) which is the base layer of an GraphQL would look like HTTP handler.

All that is missing to use that method is translating the web-framework native request object into [HTTPGraphQLRequest](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/httpgraphqlrequest).

#### Mapping into [HTTPGraphQLRequest](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/httpgraphqlrequest)

[HTTPGraphQLRequest](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/httpgraphqlrequest) only require 3 properties: the GraphQLRequest object, the HTTP headers, and the HTTP method.

```swift {2-4} showLineNumbers copy
struct HTTPGraphQLRequest {
    var request: GraphQLRequest
    var headers: HTTPHeaders
    var method: HTTPMethod
}
```

The important part is parsing into [GraphQLRequest](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/graphqlrequest).
This can be done by making sure the web-framework request object conforms to the [GraphQLRequestConvertible](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/graphqlrequestconvertible) protocol.

After that, the [GraphQLRequest](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/graphqlrequest) can be accessed from the property [.graphql](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/graphqlrequestconvertible).

<details>
<summary> Example </summary>

```swift showLineNumbers copy
import class WebFramework.Request

extension Request: GraphQLRequestConvertible {
    public func body<T>(_ decodable: T.Type) throws -> T where T: Decodable {
        try JSONDecoder().decode(decodable, from: body)
    }

    public func searchParams<T>(_ decodable: T.Type, at: String) -> T? where T: Decodable {
        search[at]?.removingPercentEncoding
            .flatMap { $0.data(using: .utf8) }
            .flatMap { try? JSONDecoder().decode(decodable, from: $0) }
    }

    public var isAcceptingGraphQLResponse: Bool {
        headers[.accept].contains(HTTPGraphQLRequest.mediaType)
    }
}
```

</details>

#### Getting the context

It's important that the context should be computed / derived for each request. By convention, it's best to allow user of the integration to compute the context from the request and the response object of the web-framework.

If the compute function is allowed to be asynchronous, make sure to make it `Sendable` conformance by adding the `@Sendable` function wrapper.

<details>
<summary> Example </summary>

```swift showLineNumbers copy
import class WebFramework.Request
import class WebFramework.Response
import struct Pioneer.Pioneer

extension Pioneer {
    typealias WebFrameworkHTTPContext = @Sendable (Request, Response) async throws -> Context
}
```

</details>

#### Executing and using [HTTPGraphQLResponse](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/httpgraphqlresponse)

Once, there is a way to retreive [HTTPGraphQLRequest](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/httpgraphqlrequest) and the context. All is needed is to execute the request and mapped the [HTTPGraphQLRequest](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/httpgraphqlresponse) into the web-framework response object.

```swift {2-3} showLineNumbers copy
struct HTTPGraphQLResponse {
    var result: GraphQLResult
    var status: HTTPResponseStatus
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The property [.graphql](#mapping-into-httpgraphqlrequest) may throw a
  [GraphQLViolation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/graphqlviolation)
  error. This error should be caught, the its message and status value should be
  use in the response to comply with the GraphQL over HTTP specification.
</Callout>

<details>
<summary> Example </summary>

```swift {9-14,16-19,23-24,26-28} showLineNumbers copy
import class WebFramework.Request
import class WebFramework.Response
import struct Pioneer.Pioneer
import struct GraphQL.GraphQLJSONEncoder

extension Pioneer {
    public func httpHandler(req: Request, context: @escaping WebFrameworkHTTPContext) async throws -> Response {
        do {
            // Parsing HTTPGraphQLRequest and Context
            guard let httpreq = req.graphql else {
                return Response(status: .badRequest)
            }
            let res = Response()
            let context = try await context(req, res)

            // Executing into GraphQLResult
            let httpRes = await executeHTTPGraphQLRequest(for: httpreq, with: context, using: req.eventLoop)
            res.body = try GraphQLJSONEncoder().encode(httpres.result)
            res.status = httpRes.status

            return res
        } catch let e as GraphQLViolation {
            let body = try GraphQLJSONEncoder().encode(GraphQLResult(data: nil, errors: [.init(e.message)]))
            return Response(status: e.status(req.isAcceptingGraphQLResponse), body: body)
        } catch {
            // Format error caught into GraphQLResult
            let body = try GraphQLJSONEncoder().encode(GraphQLResult(data: nil, errors: [.init(error)]))
            return Response(status: .internalServerError, body: body)
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

### Implementing GraphQL IDE

This is part is relatively simple, send back the web-framework response that contains the HTML for the given IDE or a redirect if the IDE was set to be a redirect.

The HTML for each type of IDE are available as computed properties of Pioneer. The URL for the Cloud IDEs are accessible property.

All that is needed is to serve this HTML and redirect if the IDE option is a redirect using the URL given.

<details>
<summary> Example </summary>

```swift {7-15} showLineNumbers copy
import class WebFramework.Request
import class WebFramework.Response
import struct Pioneer.Pioneer

extension Pioneer {
    func ideHandler(req: Request) -> Response {
        switch (playground) {
            case .sandbox:
                return serve(html: embeddedSandboxHtml)
            case .graphiql:
                return serve(html: graphiqlHtml)
            case .playground:
                return serve(html: playgroundHtml)
            case .redirect(to: let cloud):
                return Response(status: .permanentRedirect, redirect: cloud.url)
        }
    }

    func serve(html: String) -> Response {
        Response(
            status: .ok,
            headers: ["Content-Type": "text/html"],
            body: html.data(using: .utf8)
        )
    }
}
```

### Implemeting GraphQL over WebSocket

Implementing the WebSocket layer can be tricky to do. Pioneer already provide all the callbacks need to setup GraphQL over WebSocket, the only thing missing is to connect that to the WebSocket portion of the web-framework.

#### Upgrading HTTP Request into WebSocket

It is important that the desired web-framework can be used to perform upgrade to WebSocket from a regular HTTP requests.

The only thing needed to be done before the upgrade is done, is to check whether the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header value is matching the WebSocket protocol name

<details>
<summary> Example </summary>

```swift {6-12} showLineNumbers copy
import class WebFramework.Request
import struct WebFramework.BadRequestError
import struct Pioneer.Pioneer

extension Pioneer {
    func shouldUpgrade(req: Request) async throws -> HTTPHeaders {
        guard let req.headers[.secWebSocketProtocol].first(where: websocketProtocol.isValid) else {
            throw BadRequestError()
        }

        return req.headers
    }
}
```

</details>

#### Context and Guard

Before proceeding, similarly to HTTP, context is a crutial part of the GraphQL operation. By convention for WebSocket, it's best to allow user of the integration to compute the context from the request, the initial payload, and the GraphQL operation itself.

The only other addition is WebSocket guard. It is also desirable for the user to be able to perform action just after the initialisation process using the request and the initial payload.

<details>
<summary> Example </summary>

```swift {7-8} showLineNumbers copy
import class WebFramework.Request
import struct Pioneer.Pioneer
import struct Pioneer.GraphQLRequest
import enum Pioneer.Payload

extension Pioneer {
    typealias WebFrameworkWebSocketContext = @Sendable (Request, Payload, GraphQLRequest) async throws -> Context
    typealias WebFrameworkWebSocketGuard = @Sendable (Request, Payload) async throws -> Void
}
```

</details>

#### Making WebSocket WebSocketable

In order for Pioneer to use the web-framework specific implementation of WebSocket. The web-framework WebSocket object must conforms the [WebSocketable](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/websocketable) protocol.

<details>
<summary> Example </summary>

```swift {5-7,9-11} showLineNumbers copy
import enum NIOWebSocket.WebSocketErrorCode
import class WebFramework.WebSocket

extension WebSocket: WebSocketable {
    public func out<S>(_ msg: S) where S: Collection, S.Element == Character {
        send(msg)
    }

    public func terminate(code: WebSocketErrorCode) async throws {
        try await close(code: code)
    }
}
```

</details>

#### Setting up GraphQL over WebSocket

After the upgrade is done, there's only a few things to do:

- Create a new `UUID` to uniquely identify the connection.
- Setup `Task`s for keeping the connection alive and timeout connection if initialisation didn't happen.
  - This can be performed using the [.keepAlive](<https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/keepalive(using:)>) and the [.timeout](<https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/timeout(using:keepalive)>) method.
  - [.timeout](<https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/timeout(using:keepalive)>) might want to be called after [.keepAlive](<https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/keepalive(using:)>), because it optionally require the keep alive task as an argument.
- Creating a task or a stream to consume the incoming WebSocket messages
  - [.receiveMessage](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer) method is used here.
  - For consuming the incoming message, if in the web-framework it is done in a callback, it is best to pipe that value into an AsyncStream first and iterate through the AsyncStream before calling the [.receiveMessage](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer) method.
- Setting up callback for when the connection has been closed.
  - [.disposeClient](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer) method is used here.
  - It is also recommended if possible to stop the consuming incoming message here as well.

```swift {7-15,24,27-28,31-56,59-64} showLineNumbers copy
import class WebFramework.Request
import class WebFramework.Response
import class WebFramework.WebSocket
import struct Pioneer.Pioneer

extension Pioneer {
    func wsHandler(
        req: Request,
        context: @escaping WebFrameworkWebSocketContext,
        guard: @escaping WebFrameworkWebSocketGuard
    ) async throws -> Response {
        req.upgradeToWebSocket(shouldUpgrade: shouldUpgrade(req:)) { req, ws
            onUpgrade(req: req, ws: ws, context: context, guard: `guard`)
        }
    }


    func onUpgrade(
        req: Request,
        ws: WebSocket,
        context: @escaping WebFrameworkWebSocketContext,
        guard: @escaping WebFrameworkWebSocketGuard
    ) -> Void {
        let cid = UUID()

        // Keep alive and timeout task
        let keepAlive = keepAlive(using: ws)
        let timeout = timeout(using: ws, keepAlive: keepAlive)

        // Consuming incoming message
        let receiving = Task {
            let stream = AsyncStream(String.self) { con in
                ws.onMessage(con.yield)

                con.onTermination = { @Sendable _ in
                    guard ws.isClosed else { return }
                    _ = ws.close()
                }
            }

            for await message in stream {
                await receiveMessage(
                    cid: cid, io: ws,
                    keepAlive: keepAlive,
                    timeout: timeout,
                    ev: req.eventLoop,
                    txt: message,
                    context: {
                        try await context(req, $0, $1)
                    },
                    check: {
                        try await `guard`(req, $0)
                    }
                )
            }
        }

        // Closing task
        Task {
            try await ws.onClose.get()
            receiving.cancel()
            disposeClient(cid: cid, keepAlive: keepAlive, timeout: timeout)
        }
    }
}
```
