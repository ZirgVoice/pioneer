# Subscriptions

Subscriptions are long-lasting GraphQL read operations that can update their result whenever a particular server-side event occurs. Subscriptions are most commonly used to pushed updated results from the server to subscribing clients. 

## Resolving a subscription

Resolvers for Subscription differ from resolvers for fields of other types. Specifically, Subscription resolvers require to return an implementation of `EventStream`.

```swift {3-11,14-16} filename="Resolver.swift" showLineNumbers copy
struct Resolver {
    // Example using an async stream generator
    func hello(_: Context, _: NoArguments) async -> EventStream<String> {
        let stream = AsyncStream { con in
            for word in ["Hello", "Bonjour", "Ciao"] {
                con.yield(word)
            }
            con.finish()
        }
        return stream.toEventStream()
    }

    // Example using pubsub
    func hello(_: Context, _: NoArguments) async -> EventStream<String> {
        pubsub.asyncStream(String.self, for: "HELLO_MESSAGE").toEventStrem()
    }
}
```

For the subscription to work under [Pioneer](/) the resolver function must return an `EventStream` of type: 
- [AsyncEventStream](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/asynceventstream) 
  > Can be from any `AsyncSequence`, a standard protocol in Swift 5.5 for asynchronous, sequential, iterated elements
- [ConcurrentEventStream](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/GraphQL/blob/dda63e412745832adaa4b4248501bebd9133a699/Sources/GraphQL/Subscription/EventStream.swift#L14) 
  > Must be from a `AsyncThrowingStream`


## AsyncEventStream

Swift 5.5 brought in a reactive stream like feature in the form of a protocol named `AsyncSequence`.

Pioneer provide an implementation of `EventStream` named [AsyncEventStream](#asynceventstream) that takes a generic `AsyncSequence`. This mean you can create an event stream using this class from any `AsyncSequence`.

```swift showLineNumbers copy
let eventStream: EventStream<Int> = AsyncEventStream(from: MyIntAsyncSequence())
```

### Extensions for AsyncSequence

Converting can be done as well with using the extended method for all `AsyncSequence`. This method also allow the [AsyncEventStream](#asynceventstream) to emit an initial and/or an ending value. 

```swift {2,6,10} showLineNumbers copy
let eventStream = AsyncStream<Int>(...)
    .toEventStream()

// Initial value before any stream values
let eventStream1 = AsyncStream<Int>(...)
    .toEventStream(initialValue: 0)

// End value after stream finishes (excluding termination and value is lazily loaded; hence the function there)
let eventStream2 = AsyncStream<Int>(...)
    .toEventStream(initialValue: 0, endValue: { 10 })
```


### Termination callback

By default, [AsyncEventStream](#asynceventstream) will cancel the task consuming the provided `AsyncSequence` when converting to an `AsyncStream` of a different type. For something like `AsyncStream`, this cancellation will trigger its termination callback so resources can be deallocated and prevent memory leaks of any kind.

However, a custom `AsyncSequence` might have a different trigger and approach in termination. Hence, `.toEventStream` alllow an explicit termination callback when converting to `EventStream`.

<Callout type="success" emoji="✅">
In the termination callback, you are provided with an enum that specify the two cases where termination can occur.
</Callout>

```swift {4-8} showLineNumbers copy
let sequence = MyAsyncSequence()

let eventStream = sequence.toEventStream(
    onTermination: { termination in
        if case .cancelled = termination {
            sequence.cancel()
        }
    }
)
```

Cases where stream is no longer consumed / stopped and termination will require to be triggered:
1. Stream ended itself
2. Client send a explicit stop request to end the subscription (might be before stream ended)
3. Client disconnect and implicitly stop any running subscription

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚡️">
Termination callback can be implicitly inferred built-in `AsyncSequence` and ones created by a [PubSub](#pubsub-as-protocol).
</Callout>

## AsyncPubSub

Pioneer provide an in memory publish-subscribe (**Pub/Sub**) model named, [AsyncPubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/asyncpubsub), to concurrent safely track events and update all active subscribers.

[AsyncPubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/asyncpubsub) conforms to [PubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pubsub) which enables your server code to both publish events to a particular topic/trigger/string and listen for events associated with a particular topic.

```swift showLineNumbers copy
import struct Pioneer.AsyncPubSub

let pubsub = AsyncPubSub()
```

### Publishing an event

You can publish an event using the [.publish](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/asyncpubsub/publish(for:payload:)) method:

```swift showLineNumbers copy
await pubsub.publish(
    for: "POST_CREATED", 
    payload: Post(by: "Jeff Bezos", content: "How much money do I have?")
)
```

- The first parameter is the trigger of the event you're publishing to, as a string.
  - You don't need to register a trigger name before publishing to it.
- The second parameter is the payload associated with the event.

As an example, let's say our GraphQL API supports a `createPost` mutation. A basic resolver for that might look this:

```swift {2-6} showLineNumbers copy
struct Resolver {
    func createPost(ctx: Context, args: CreatePostArgs) async throws -> Post {
        let post = Post(args: args)
        try await post.create(on: ctx.req.db)
        return post
    }
}
```
<details> 
<summary> Schema </summary>
The example schema in [Graphiti](https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti):

```swift showLineNumbers copy
Mutation {
    Field("createPost", at: Resolver.createPost) {
        Arguments("author", at: \.author)
        Arguments("content", at: \.content)
    }
}
```

The example schema in GraphQL SDL:

```graphql showLineNumbers copy
type Mutation {
  createPost(author: String, content: String): Post!
}
```

</details>

After we successfully persist the new post into the database, we can publish it to the pubsub as an event.

```swift {5} showLineNumbers copy
struct Resolver {
    func createPost(ctx: Context, args: CreatePostArgs) async throws -> Post {
        let post = Post(args: args)
        try await post.create(on: ctx.req.db)
        await pubsub.publish(for: "POST_CREATED", post)
        return post
    }
}
```

Next, we can listen for this event in our `Subscription` resolver.

### Listening for events

An `AsyncStream` asynchronously iterate over events, and if that stream comes from a [PubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pubsub), it will be associated with a particular trigger and will receive the events published under that trigger.

You can create an `AsyncStream` by calling the [.asyncStream](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/asyncpubsub/asyncstream(_:for:)) method and passing in a the event trigger that this stream should listen for and the type.

```swift showLineNumbers copy
pubsub.asyncStream(Post.self, for: "POST_CREATED");
```

Which would looke this in a subscription resolver:

```swift {2-4} filename="Resolver.swift" showLineNumbers copy
struct Resolver {
    func postCreated(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async -> EventStream<Post> {
        ctx.pubsub.asyncStream(Post.self, for: "POST_CREATED").toEventStrem()
    }
}
```

## Custom Pub/Sub

As mentioned before, [AsyncPubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/async-pubsub) is an in memory pub-sub implementation that is limited to a single server instance, which may become an issue on production environments where there are multiple distributed server instances.

In which case, you likely want to either use or implement a custom pub-sub system that is backed by an external datastore.

### PubSub as protocol

<Callout type="info" emoji="🧩">
Pub/Sub implementation conform to this protocol is enforced to have the same API to [AsyncPubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/asyncpubsub), which make easy to switch between.

However, it is **not necessary** to use [PubSub](#pubsub-as-protocol) for your subscription resolver and to build a custom Pub/Sub implementation.
</Callout>

Pioneer exported the [PubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pubsub) protocol which allow different implementation with the same API [AsyncPubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/async-pubsub) notably implementation backed by popular event-publishing systems (i.e. Redis) with similar API which allow user of this library to prototype with the in memory AsyncPubSub and easily migrate to a distributed PubSub implementation without very little changes.

The basic rules to implement A [PubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pubsub) are as follow:

<details open="true">
<summary> <b> Conformance </b> </summary>

The method [.asyncStream](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pubsub/asyncstream(_:for:)) should return an `AsyncStream` for a single subscriber where it can be unsubscribed without closing the topic entirely.
- The type of `DataType` should conform to `Sendable` and `Decodabble` to help make sure it is safe to pass around and be able to decoded if necessary (since it is likely to come from a network call).
- Recommended to create a new `AsyncStream` on each method call.
- If you are having trouble with broadcasting a publisher to multiple consumer/subscriber, recommended taking a look at [Broadcast](#broadcast).

The method [.publish](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pubsub/publish(for:payload:)) should publish events to all subscriber that associated with the trigger.
- The `DataType` conform to `Sendable` and `Encodable` to help make sure it is safe to pass around and be able to encoded if necessary (since it is likely to be send on a network call).

The method [.close](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pubsub/close(for:)) should dispose and shutdown all subscriber that associated with the trigger.

</details>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

The implementation should be free of data races and be working safely under asynchronous scopes.

If you are having trouble with data-race safe state management, recommended use Swift's [Actor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/actor).

</Callout>

### Broadcast

Additionally, common client libraries for popular event-publishing systems usually only provide a function that to subscribe to a specific publisher, but

- No option of unsubscribing without closing the publisher entirely
- Only allow 1 subscriber for each publisher / channel
  - Usually because subscription is its own new network connection and multiple of those can be resource intensive.

In this case, the actor, [Broadcast](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/broadcast), is provided which can broadcast any events from a publisher to multiple different downstream where each downstream share the same upstream and can be unsubscribed / disposed (to prevent leaks) without closing the upstream and publisher.

[Broadcast](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/broadcast) provide the methods:
> - [.downstream](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/broadcast/downstream()) to create a new subscriber stream that will receive events broadcasted 
> - [.publish](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/broadcast/publish(_:)) to broadcast the events to all subscriber
> - [.close](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/broadcast/close()) to close the broadcast and shutdown all subscriber

Essentially, it will be applied on an event publisher to create multiple [downstream(s)](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/downstream) and handle distribution of events, where:

- Different consumer can subscribe to the same upstream and all of them get the same messages
  > Usually to prevent making multiple subscription might be resource intensive

- [Downstream(s)](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/downstream) can be disposed, stopped, or cancelled individually to prevent leaks
  > Disposed by cancelling `Task` used to consume it

- Closing any [downstream(s)](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/downstream) does not close other [downstream(s)](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/downstream), broadcast, and the upstream
  > Other [downstream(s)](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/downstream) will continue receiving broadcasted events

- Closing broadcast dispose all [downstream(s)](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/downstream), but not necessarily the upstream

<details>
<summary> Example </summary>

```swift showLineNumbers copy
let broadcast = Broadcast<Event>()
receiveSubscriptionFromExternalPublisher(
    ...,
    onMessage: { msg async in
        let event = convertToEvent(msg)
        await broadcast.publish(event)
    },
    onFinished: { reason async in
        await broadcast.close()
    }
)

// All of these downstream are getting all messages from the upstream
let downstream0 = await broadcast.downstream().stream
let downstream1 = await broadcast.downstream().stream
let downstream2 = await broadcast.downstream().stream
let downstream3 = await broadcast.downstream().stream

sendToExternalPublisher(..., msg: SomeMessage())

// Dispose a downstream without effecting the others
let task3 = Task {
    for await msg in downstream3 {
        // ...
    }
}

task3.cancel()


// Shutdown all downstreams
closeExternalPublisher(...)
await broadcast.close()
```

</details>

### Redis Example

As an example, say we want to build a redis backed [PubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pubsub).

<Callout type="error" emoji="⛔️">
This is only meant to be an example to give a better idea on how to implement a custom implementation that conform to [PubSub](#pubsub-as-protocol) and utilize [Broadcast](#broadcast).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="️🚀">
A package, [PioneerRedisPubSub](https://github.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer-redis-pubsub), provide a Redis implemention of [PubSub](#pubsub-as-protocol) where it has been optimised and tested.
</Callout>

Here we create an example implementation of [PubSub](#pubsub-as-protocol) using Redis, that utilize Redis channel for Pub/Sub. We also make use of [Broadcast](#broadcast) to not open multiple connection and use the 1 redis subscription connection for all GraphQL subscription of the same topic.

```swift showLineNumbers copy filename="RedisPubSub.swift"
import Foundation
import NIOFoundationCompat
import class Pioneer.Broadcast
import struct Redis.RedisChannelName
import protocol Pioneer.PubSub
import protocol Redis.RedisClient

struct RedisPubSub: PubSub {

    // MARK: - Actor for distribution
    actor Dispatcher {
        private let redis: RedisClient
        private var broadcasting: [String: Broadcast<Data>] = [:]

        init(_ redis: RedisClient) {
            self.redis = redis
        }

        /// Get a downstream from the broadcast for the channel given
        func downstream(to channel: String) async throws -> AsyncStream<Data> {
            let broadcast = try await subscribe(to: channel)
            let downstream = await broadcast.downstream()
            return downstream.stream
        }

        /// Get the broadcast for the channel if exist, otherwise make a new one
        private func subscribe(to channel: String) async throws -> Broadcast<Data> {
            if let broadcast = broadcasting[channel] {
                return broadcast
            }
            let broadcast = Broadcast<Data>()
            broadcasting[channel] = broadcast
            try await apply(from: .init(channel), to: broadcast)
            return broadcast
        }

        /// Apply broadcasting to the Redis channel subscription
        private func apply(from channel: RedisChannelName, to broadcast: Broadcast<Data>) async throws {
            do {
                try await redis.subscribe(
                    to: channel,
                    messageReceiver: { _, msg in
                        guard case .bulkString(.some(let buffer)) = msg else { return }
                        let data = Data(buffer: buffer)
                        Task {
                            await broadcast.publish(data)
                        }
                    },
                    onUnsubscribe: { _, _ in
                        Task {
                            await broadcast.close()
                        }
                    }
                )
                .get()
            } catch {
              await broadcast.close()
              throw error
            }
        }

        /// Pubblish the data (which is RESPValueConvertible) to the specific redis channel
        func publish(for channel: String, _ value: Data) async throws {
            let _ = try await redis.publish(value, to: .init(channel)).get()
        }

        /// Close the redis channel subscription and all of the downstreams
        func close(for channel: String) async throws {
            try await redis.unsubscribe(from: .init(channel)).get()
            await broadcasting[channel]?.close()
        }
    }

    // MARK: -- Protocol required methods

    public func asyncStream<DataType: Sendable & Decodable>(_ type: DataType.Type = DataType.self, for trigger: String) -> AsyncThrowingStream<DataType, Error> {
        AsyncThrowingStream<DataType, Error> { con in
            let task = Task {
                do {
                    let stream = try await dispatcher.downstream(to: trigger)
                    for await data in stream {
                        do {
                            let event = try JSONDecoder().decode(DataType.self, data)
                            con.yield(event)
                        } catch {
                            con.finish(throwing: error)
                        }
                    }
                    con.finish()
                } catch {
                    con.finish(throwing: error)
                }
            }
            con.onTermination = { @Sendable _ in
                task.cancel()
            }
        }
    }

    public func publish<DataType: Sendable & Encodable>(for trigger: String, payload: DataType) async throws {
        let data = try JSONEncoder().encode(payload)
        try await dispatcher.publish(for: trigger, data)
    }

    public func close(for trigger: String) async throws {
        try await dispatcher.close(for: trigger)
    }

    // MARK: - Properties

    private let dispatcher: Dispatcher

    public init(_ redis: RedisClient) {
        self.dispatcher = .init(redis)
    }
}
```

Now we can have the Resolver to have a property `pubsub` of type [PubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pubsub) instead of [AsyncPubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/async-pubsub), while still being able to use [AsyncPubSub](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/async-pubsub) during development.

```swift {1} filename="Message.swift" showLineNumbers copy
struct Message: Sendable, Codable { ... }
```

```swift {2,6,11} showLineNumbers copy filename="Resolver.swift"
struct Resolver {
    let pubsub: PubSub = app.environment.isRelease ? RedisPubSub(app.redis) : AsyncPubSub()

    func create(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async throws -> Message {
        let message = ...
        try await pubsub.publish(message)
        return message
    }

    func onCreate(ctx: Context, _: NoArguments) async -> EventStream<Message> {
        pubsub.asyncStream(Message.self, for: "message-create").toEventStream()
    }
}
```

So now, if we can use the `RedisPubSub` on a production environment.
