# Migrating to v1

One of the big goal of [v1](/) is to bring fully bring a stable release of Pioneer with all the features and changes added in the past year, and allow Pioneer to be more customisable, and more compatible with more server-side Swift frameworks and libraries.

## Decoupling from Vapor

Pioneer also now no longer a [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor)-only library and exposes more of its internal functions, structs, protocols, and classes which will allow integrations with other web frameworks.

<Callout type="info" emoji="🎉">
Pioneer [v1](/) will still have first-party integration for [Vapor](/docs/web-frameworks/vapor).
</Callout>

### Middleware

Pioneer will no longer add routes to a [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) Application with the `.applyMiddleware` function.

Instead, Pioneer will have a [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) integration module that extends [Pioneer](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer) with [VaporGraphQLMiddleware](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/vaporgraphqlmiddleware) which can be use like a regular [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) middleware.

```swift {8} showLineNumbers copy
let app = try Application(.detect())

let server = Pioneer(
	schema: schema,
	resolver: resolver
)

app.middleware.use(server.vaporMiddleware())
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```swift {8} showLineNumbers copy
let app = try Application(.detect())

let server = Pioneer(
	schema: schema,
	resolver: resolver
)

server.applyMiddleware(on: app)
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Context Builder

Alongside being a middleware, all context builder and guard functions are passed into the middleware instead of directly to Pioneer. This allow Pioneer be decoupled from Vapor but still allow integration with Vapor's `Request` and `Response` in the context builder.

<Tabs items={['v1', 'v0']}>
<Tab>

```swift {8-13} showLineNumbers copy
let server = Pioneer(
	schema: schema,
	resolver: resolver
)

app.middleware.use(
	server.vaporMiddleware(
		context: { req, res in
			...
		},
		websocketContext: { req, payload, gql in
			...
		}
	)
)
```

</Tab>
<Tab>


```swift {4-9} showLineNumbers copy
let server = Pioneer(
	schema: schema,
	resolver: resolver,
	contextBuilder: { req, res in 
		...
	},
	websocketContextBuilder: { req, params, gql in 
		...
	}
)

server.applyMiddleware(on: app)
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### WebSocket Guard

Pioneer now properly implement a WebSocket initialisation guard, which will fire for each new GraphQL over WebSocket connection that initialise properly. This allow user configured authorization of each WebSocket connection.

```swift {14-16} showLineNumbers copy
let server = Pioneer(
    schema: schema,
    resolver: resolver
)

app.middleware.use(
    server.vaporMiddleware( 
        context: { req, res in
            ...
				},
        websocketContext: { req, payload, gql in
            ...
        },
        websocketGuard: { req, payload in
            ...
        }
    )
)
```

### Same path for all

Pioneer **v0** uses 3 different paths for GraphQL over HTTP, GraphQL over WebSocket, and GraphQL IDE hosting.

In [**v1**](/), Pioneer will use the same path for all of those, and will instead determine from the request whether is a GraphQL over HTTP request, a GraphQL over WebSocket upgrade request, or a GraphQL IDE request.


### Standalone server

Pioneer will also now include option to run [standalone](/docs/web-frameworks/standalone).

```swift {6-16} showLineNumbers copy
let server = Pioneer(
    schema: schema,
    resolver: resolver
)

try server.standaloneServer(
    context: { req, res in
        ...
	},
    websocketContext: { req, payload, gql in
        ...
    },
    websocketGuard: { req, payload in
        ...
    }
)
```


<Callout type="info" emoji="︎🤝">
Under the hood, the standalone server uses the [Vapor](/docs/web-frameworks/vapor) integration.
</Callout>

## Other changes

### New defaults

Pioneer will now defaults to 
- [.csrfPrevention](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/httpstrategy-swift.enum/csrfprevention) for its [HTTPStrategy](/docs/features/graphql-over-http/#http-strategy)
- [.graphqlWs](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/websocketprotocol-swift.enum/graphqlws) for its [WebSocket Protocol](/docs/features/graphql-over-websocket/#websocket-subprotocol)
- [.sandbox](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/ide/sandbox) for its [GraphQL IDE](/docs/features/graphql-ide)
- `30` seconds for the keep alive interval for GraphQL over WebSocket

### Deprecating `subscriptions-transport-ws`

As of Mar 4 2022, the [subscriptions-transport-ws](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws) has been made read-only archive and will be marked as deprecated in Pioneer. 
Pioneer will now defaults to the [`graphql-ws`](/docs/features/graphql-over-websocket/#websocket-subprotocol) instead. 

### WebSocket callbacks

Some WebSocket callbacks are now exposed as functions in Pioneer. These can be used to add a custom WebSocket layer.

- [.receiveMessage](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer)
	- Callback to be called for each WebSocket message
- [.createClient](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer)
	- Callback after getting a GraphQL over WebSocket initialisation message according to the given protocol
- [.executeLongOperation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer)
	- Callback to run long running operation using Pioneer
- [.executeShortOperation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer)
	- Callback to run short lived operation using Pioneer

### Pioneer capabilities

Some other capabilities of Pioneer is now exposed:

- [.allowed](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/allowed(from:allowing:)), Check if a GraphQL request is allowed given the allowed list of operations

- [.csrfVulnerable](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/csrfvulnerable(given:)), Check if the headers given show signs of CSRF and XS-Search vulnerability

- [.executeHTTPGraphQLRequest](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/csrfvulnerable(given:)), Execute an operation for a given [HTTPGraphQLRequest](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/httpgraphqlrequest) and returns  [HTTPGraphQLResponse](https://swiftpackageindex.com/d-exclaimation/pioneer/documentation/pioneer/pioneer/httpgraphqlresponse)

### ConnectionParams to Payload

The type `ConnectionParams` is renamed to `Payload`

```swift showLineNumbers copy
typealias Payload = [String: Map]?
```
